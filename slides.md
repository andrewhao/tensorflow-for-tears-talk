## My son was/is colicky.

That means he's uncomfortable, but we don't know why<sup>*</sup>

## Machine learning is interesting.

*What if I could get a machine to suffer through all this?*

---

## Machine learning for dummies

* Machines are good at patterns
* Given enough data
* And math (stats)

---

## Neural networks

A neural network is a data structure meant to simulate biological processes (like your brain)

---

## Neural networks

Simplified model - each node is connected to other nodes, stores a value (weight)

---

## Neural networks

The value (weight) of each node determines whether it "passes" a signal down to other nodes downstream.

---

## Neural networks

Layers of nodes rest on top of each other, allowing the network to encode more information.

---

## Our goals today

1. Get data
2. Classify data
3. Preprocess data
4. Train model
5. Run model on new data
